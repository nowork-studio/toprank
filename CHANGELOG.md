## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Autoupdate system** — skills now check GitHub for new versions on every invocation
  - `bin/toprank-update-check` — fetches `VERSION` from GitHub with 60-min cache; outputs `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>` or nothing
  - `bin/toprank-config` — read/write `~/.toprank/config.yaml`; supports `update_check`, `auto_upgrade` keys
  - `toprank-upgrade/SKILL.md` — upgrade skill with inline and standalone flows, snooze (24h/48h/7d backoff), auto-upgrade mode, changelog diff
  - Preamble in `seo-analysis` and auto-inject via `setup` for all future skills
  - `bin/preamble.md` — single source of truth for the preamble template
- `VERSION` file — tracks current release for update checks

### Fixed
- `toprank-update-check`: validate local VERSION format before writing cache; exit after `JUST_UPGRADED` to prevent dual stdout output; move `mkdir -p` to top of script
- `setup`: atomic SKILL.md writes via temp file + `os.replace()`; add `pipefail` to catch silent Python errors
- `toprank-upgrade`: clear stale `.bak` before vendored upgrade to prevent collision

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **README intro** — rewritten to lead with user outcome ("Finally know what to do about your SEO") and emphasize zero-risk install; blockquote examples now show real questions users would type
