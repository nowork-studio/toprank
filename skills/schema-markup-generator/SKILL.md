  Generate JSON-LD structured data markup for rich results in Google Search.
  Supports FAQ, HowTo, Article, Product, LocalBusiness, and multi-type schemas.
  Validates against Google requirements and provides implementation guidance.
  Use when asked to "add schema markup", "generate structured data", "JSON-LD",
  "rich snippets", "FAQ schema", "product markup", "add structured data to my
  page", "how to get rich snippets", or any structured data task.

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.claude/skills/toprank/bin/toprank-update-check 2>/dev/null || \
       ~/.claude/skills/stockholm/bin/toprank-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
```

If the output contains `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: immediately follow the inline upgrade flow in the `/toprank-upgrade` skill (Step 1 onward) to auto-upgrade, then return here and continue.

If the output contains `JUST_UPGRADED <old> <new>`: mention "toprank upgraded from v{old} to v{new}" briefly, then continue.

# Schema Markup Generator

This skill creates Schema.org structured data markup in JSON-LD format to help search engines understand your content and enable rich results in SERPs.

## When This Must Trigger

Use this when the conversation involves any of these situations — even if the user does not use SEO terminology:

Use this whenever the task needs a shippable asset or transformation that should feed directly into quality review, deployment, or monitoring.

- Adding FAQ schema for expanded SERP presence
- Creating How-To schema for step-by-step content
- Adding Product schema for e-commerce pages
- Implementing Article schema for blog posts
- Adding Local Business schema for location pages
- Creating Review/Rating schema
- Implementing Organization schema for brand presence
- Any page where rich results would improve visibility

## What This Skill Does

1. **Schema Type Selection**: Recommends appropriate schema types
2. **JSON-LD Generation**: Creates valid structured data markup
3. **Property Mapping**: Maps your content to schema properties
4. **Validation Guidance**: Ensures schema meets requirements
5. **Nested Schema**: Handles complex, multi-type schemas
6. **Rich Result Eligibility**: Identifies which rich results you can target

## Quick Start

Start with one of these prompts.

### Generate Schema for Content

```
Generate schema markup for this [content type]: [content/URL]
```

```
Create FAQ schema for these questions and answers: [Q&A list]
```

### Specific Schema Types

```
Create Product schema for [product name] with [details]
```

```
Generate LocalBusiness schema for [business name and details]
```

### Audit Existing Schema

```
Review and improve this schema markup: [existing schema]
```

## Data Sources

**With ~~web crawler connected:**
Automatically crawl and extract page content (visible text, headings, lists, tables), existing schema markup, page metadata, and structured content elements that map to schema properties.

**With manual data only:**
Ask the user to provide:
1. Page URL or full HTML content
2. Page type (article, product, FAQ, how-to, local business, etc.)
3. Specific data needed for schema (prices, dates, author info, Q&A pairs, etc.)
4. Current schema markup (if optimizing existing)

Proceed with the full workflow using provided data. Note in the output which data is from automated extraction vs. user-provided data.

## Instructions

When a user requests schema markup:

1. **Identify Content Type and Rich Result Opportunity**

   Reference the CORE-EEAT Benchmark item **O05 (Schema Markup)** for content-type to schema mapping:

   ```markdown
   ### CORE-EEAT Schema Mapping (O05)

   | Content Type | Required Schema | Conditional Schema |
   |-------------|----------------|--------------------|
   | Blog (guides) | Article, Breadcrumb | FAQ, HowTo |
   | Blog (tools) | Article, Breadcrumb | FAQ, Review |
   | Blog (insights) | Article, Breadcrumb | FAQ |
   | Alternative | Comparison*, Breadcrumb, FAQ | AggregateRating |
   | Best-of | ItemList, Breadcrumb, FAQ | AggregateRating per tool |
   | Use-case | WebPage, Breadcrumb, FAQ | — |
   | FAQ | FAQPage, Breadcrumb | — |
   | Landing | SoftwareApplication, Breadcrumb, FAQ | WebPage |
   | Testimonial | Review, Breadcrumb | FAQ, Person |

   *Use the mapping above to ensure schema type matches content type (CORE-EEAT O05: Pass criteria).*
   ```

   ```markdown
   ### Schema Analysis

   **Content Type**: [blog/product/FAQ/how-to/local business/etc.]
   **Page URL**: [URL]

   **Eligible Rich Results**:
   
   | Rich Result Type | Eligibility | Impact |
   |------------------|-------------|--------|
   | FAQ | ✅/❌ | High - Expands SERP presence |
   | How-To | ✅/❌ | Medium - Shows steps in SERP |
   | Product | ✅/❌ | High - Shows price, availability |
   | Review | ✅/❌ | High - Shows star ratings |
   | Article | ✅/❌ | Medium - Shows publish date, author |
   | Breadcrumb | ✅/❌ | Medium - Shows navigation path |
   | Video | ✅/❌ | High - Shows video thumbnail |
   
   **Recommended Schema Types**:
   1. [Primary schema type] - [reason]
   2. [Secondary schema type] - [reason]
   ```

2. **Generate Schema Markup**

   Based on the identified content type, generate the appropriate JSON-LD schema. Supported types: FAQPage, HowTo, Article/BlogPosting/NewsArticle, Product, LocalBusiness, Organization, BreadcrumbList, Event, Recipe, and combined multi-type schemas.

   > **Reference**: See [references/schema-templates.md](references/schema-templates.md) for complete, copy-ready JSON-LD templates for all schema types with required and optional properties.

   For each schema generated, include:
   - All required properties for the chosen type
   - Rich result preview showing expected SERP appearance
   - Notes on which properties are required vs. optional

   When combining multiple schema types on one page, wrap them in a JSON array inside a single `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag.

3. **Provide Implementation and Validation**

    ```markdown
    ## Implementation Guide

    ### Adding Schema to Your Page

    **Option 1: In HTML <head>**
    ```html
    <head>
      <script type="application/ld+json">
        [Your JSON-LD schema here]
      </script>
    </head>
    ```

    **Option 2: Before closing </body>**
    ```html
      <script type="application/ld+json">
        [Your JSON-LD schema here]
      </script>
    </body>
    ```

    ### Validation Steps

    1. **~~schema validator**
       - Test your live URL or paste code
       - Check for errors and warnings

    2. **Schema.org Validator**
       - URL: https://validator.schema.org/
       - Validates against Schema.org spec

    3. **~~search console**
       - Monitor rich results in ~~search console
       - Check Enhancements reports for issues

    ### Validation Checklist

    - [ ] JSON syntax is valid (no trailing commas)
    - [ ] All required properties present
    - [ ] URLs are absolute, not relative
    - [ ] Dates are in ISO 8601 format
    - [ ] Content matches visible page content
    - [ ] No policy violations
    ```

## Validation Checkpoints

## Example

**User**: "Generate FAQ schema for a page about SEO with 3 questions"

**Output**:

```markdown
## FAQ Schema for SEO Page

### Schema Markup

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is SEO?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing websites and content to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). It involves technical optimizations, content creation, and link building to increase organic visibility and drive qualified traffic to your website."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How long does SEO take to work?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "SEO typically takes 3-6 months to show significant results, though this varies based on competition, domain authority, and effort invested. New websites may take 6-12 months, while established sites with existing authority can see improvements in 1-3 months for less competitive keywords."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is SEO better than paid advertising?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "SEO and paid advertising serve different purposes. SEO provides sustainable, long-term traffic without per-click costs but takes time to build. Paid advertising delivers immediate results but stops when you stop paying. Most successful businesses use both: paid ads for immediate leads and SEO for long-term growth."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

_Implementation: Wrap the above JSON-LD in `<script type="application/ld+json">...</script>` and place in `<head>` or before `</body>`. Test with ~~schema validator._
