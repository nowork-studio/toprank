# AdsAgent — Google Ads Management

Call Google Ads tools using the bundled CLI client.

## Configuration

All persistent config lives in `~/.adsagent/config.json`. This file survives across sessions and works in every context — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, MCP servers, etc.

The config file has this shape:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "asa_...",
  "accountId": "1234567890"
}
```

## Onboarding

Before doing anything else, check whether the user is set up. Follow these steps in order — stop at the first issue and resolve it before continuing.

### Step 0: Check for the AdsAgent MCP server

Try calling `mcp__adsagent__listConnectedAccounts`. If it responds, the MCP server is connected — skip to Step 1.

If the tool doesn't exist, the MCP server isn't configured yet. Guide the user:

> The AdsAgent MCP server isn't connected. To set it up:
>
> 1. **Get a free token** at [adsagent.org](https://www.adsagent.org)
> 2. **Add the MCP server** to your Claude settings (`mcpServers`):
>
> ```json
> {
>   "adsagent": {
>     "command": "npx",
>     "args": [
>       "-y", "mcp-remote",
>       "https://www.adsagent.org/api/mcp",
>       "--transport", "http-first",
>       "--header", "Authorization:Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
>     ]
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the token from step 1.
>
> 3. **Restart Claude** to pick up the new MCP server.
>
> If you installed toprank via the setup script, re-run `./setup --api-key YOUR_KEY` to configure everything automatically.

Note: This skill can also call tools via the bundled mcporter CLI (see "Calling tools" section below), which works without MCP server configuration. But the MCP server is recommended because other ads skills (`/ads-copy`, `/ads-audit`, `/ads-compete`) depend on it.

### Step 1: Check for token

Read `~/.adsagent/config.json` (create `~/.adsagent/` if it doesn't exist).

Look for `apiKey` (the token) in the config file. If it's present, skip to Step 2.

If it's missing, tell the user:

> To use AdsAgent, you need a free token. You can get one from [adsagent.org](https://www.adsagent.org).
> Once you have it, paste it here and I'll save it for you.

When the user provides the key, save it to `~/.adsagent/config.json`.

Then continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Select a Google Ads account

Look for `accountId` in the config file. If it's present, proceed to fulfil the user's request.

If `accountId` is not set:

1. Run `listConnectedAccounts` to get all connected Google Ads accounts.
2. **If there is exactly one account**, save it automatically — no need to bother the user. Write `accountId` to `~/.adsagent/config.json` and tell the user which account was selected (show account name and ID).
3. **If there are multiple accounts**, present them as a numbered list showing account name and ID, then ask the user to pick one. Save their choice to `~/.adsagent/config.json`.
4. **If there are zero accounts**, tell the user they don't have any Google Ads accounts connected yet and direct them to [adsagent.org](https://www.adsagent.org) to connect one.

### Switching accounts

If the user wants to switch accounts, run `listConnectedAccounts`, let them pick, and update `accountId` in `~/.adsagent/config.json`.

## Calling tools

Before calling any tool, read `~/.adsagent/config.json` and export the API key so mcporter can use it:

```bash
export ADS_AGENT_KEY="<apiKey from config>"
```

Then call tools via mcporter using the bundled config. String parameters must be quoted with double quotes inside single quotes to avoid type errors:

```bash
export ADS_AGENT_KEY="<apiKey from config>"
npx mcporter call 'google-ads.<toolName>(accountId: "<accountId from config>")' --config ~/.claude/skills/ads/mcporter.json
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# List campaigns
npx mcporter call 'google-ads.listCampaigns(accountId: "1234567890")' --config ~/.claude/skills/ads/mcporter.json

# Get keywords for a campaign
npx mcporter call 'google-ads.getKeywords(accountId: "1234567890", campaignId: "111222333")' --config ~/.claude/skills/ads/mcporter.json

# No-parameter tools
npx mcporter call google-ads.listConnectedAccounts --config ~/.claude/skills/ads/mcporter.json
```

Always pass `accountId` from `~/.adsagent/config.json` to every tool call (except `listConnectedAccounts`). All responses are JSON.

- **undoChange** — Reverse a previous write by `changeId`

## Rules

1. **Never make write changes without explicit user confirmation.** Always show what you plan to change, the current value, and the new value before executing.
2. **Start with reads.** When the user asks about ads, begin with `getAccountInfo` and `listCampaigns` to build context.
3. **Show numbers clearly.** Format cost as dollars, show CTR as percentages, include date ranges.
4. **Recommend before acting.** When you spot waste (high-spend zero-conversion keywords, irrelevant search terms), recommend the action and wait for approval.
5. **Guardrails are server-side.** Bid changes >25% and budget changes >50% will be rejected by the server. Don't try to circumvent this.
6. **After every write, note the `changeId`.** Tell the user they can undo the change within 7 days. Use `getChanges` to review recent operations.

## Common Workflows

### "How are my ads doing?"
1. `getAccountInfo` → `listCampaigns` → summarize top spenders, best/worst performers, total spend

### "Find wasted spend"
1. `listCampaigns` → pick top-spend campaigns
2. `getKeywords` for each → find high-spend, zero-conversion keywords
3. `getSearchTermReport` → find irrelevant search terms
4. Recommend: pause wasteful keywords + add negative keywords

### "Optimize bids"
1. `getKeywords` → find keywords with good conversion rates but low impression share
2. `getImpressionShare` / `getCampaignSettings` as needed for context
3. Recommend bid increases (within 25% limit) for high-performers
4. Recommend bid decreases for underperformers
